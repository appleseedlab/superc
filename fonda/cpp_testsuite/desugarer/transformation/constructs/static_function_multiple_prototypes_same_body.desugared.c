// this is an optimization.  we can "unify" types when they are "homomorphic", i.e., they are both primitive, both are fun types with same args, etc, and the primitive types used can be represented with a single primitive type that can be converted to all the others without loss of precision.  the trickiness in conversion is then the insertion of conditionals and type casting that preserves the original configurable behavior without having to duplicate so many variables and function bodies.

// rename functions vars, factor out the common body, and create multiplexer function with original name, this is an optimization that only works if parameters are the same or similar and the return types can be unified
